# Minesweeper_0.8

There is a bug where the cells don't detect bombs when revealed around the edges, kind of like ignoring the pizza crust.
It is missing the victory condition.
The CSS aligning for the info elements atop the game table is not working the way I want it to.
I'm working on the autoclear function (where it clears out all empty indexes around it until it hits a cell detecting at least 1 mine)
A timer will eventually be put in place once you start the game (when you reveal the first cell)
A custom row/collumn bomb amount will be put in place in the difficulty tab slide
