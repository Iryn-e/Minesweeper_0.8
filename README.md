# Minesweeper_0.9

It is missing the victory condition.

I'm working on the autoclear function (where it clears out all empty indexes around it until it hits a cell detecting at least 1 mine)

A timer will eventually be put in place once you start the game (when you reveal the first cell)

A custom row/collumn bomb amount will be put in place in the difficulty tab slide
